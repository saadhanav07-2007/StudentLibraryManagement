Student Library Management System
The project focuses on providing a user-friendly environment where students and administrators can perform various libraryoperations easily. The use of Java Swing ensures responsiveness, scalability, and modularity of the application.

The library website consists of several key pages:

• Home Page - Serves as the main dashboard providing navigation buttons to access all library functions.
• Add Book Page - Allows users to enter new book details such as ID, title, and author to add them to the library.
• Views Books Page - Displays a table of all available books with details like ID, title, author, and issue status.
• Issue Book Page - Enables users to issue a selected book by entering its ID and updates its status to "Issued."
• Return Book Page - Allows users to return previously issued books and marks them as "Available" again.
• Exit Page - Provides an option to close the application safely with a confirmation message.
